modelenv is a *developer focused* package designed to provide tools to register models much in the same as is [done in parsnip](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/reference/set_new_model.html). This package **does not** replace parsnip's registration functions, but will be used in tidyclust and future non-parsnip modeling packages to avoid complex dependencies.

## Installation

You can install the released version of modelenv from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("modelenv")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidymodels/modelenv")
```

## Learn more

These functions have near identical interfaces to their parsnip equivalent, see [tidymodels.org - How to build a parsnip model](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/develop/models/) for instructions of how to use these functions.
